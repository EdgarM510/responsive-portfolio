            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img class="pic" src="assets/images/headshot.png">
            <p><br><br>Oh! hi... you gave me a scare, I didn't see you there.
                <br><br>What are you doing?
                <br><br>Huh? You'd like to know about me?
                <br><br>I dare not refuse, stay a while and listen.
                <br><br>My tale begins where it is likely to end, in a charming little city named Oakland, also known as Oaktown. 
                Oaktown lays lazily on the side of a hill overlooking a beautiful and busy bay. I was made by two Mexican immigrants, born 
                the youngest of four children. It was a scrappy upbringing, particularly in my younger years before moving up the hill. 
                <br><br>For a couple of years I lived in San Jose, also known as Jotown. I still have many friends in Jotown and travel there often. 
                I had several jobs after High School: Postal Worker, Liquor Store Clerk, Theatre Usher, Electrician, Solar Panel 
                Installer, Auto-Detailer. Boring! let's talk hobbies: Yoga, Working out, Hiking, Drawing, Motorcycling, Esperanto, Cosplay, 
                Overwatch, Table-Top Role Playing Games, Boardgames, Rubik's Cubing. I am freshly turned thirty, I'm studying to become a 
                Full-Stack Web Developer and I would like to learn Mobile App Development next. 
                <br><br>So yeah... that's pretty much it.
                <br><br>I'm done talking.
                <br><br>Get a move on.
                <br><br>SHOO! SHOO!
